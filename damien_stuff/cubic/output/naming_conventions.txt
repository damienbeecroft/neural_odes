Here are the naming conventions for the .pt files in data and the folders in viz. Note that I used the same naming conventions for both.
The conventions are as follows.

[training type]_[ode type]_[neural net type]_[exponent]_[number of batches]_[frequency of loss reporting]

[training type]:
This is the method used to compute the loss gradient of the method. It is either the backpropagation [backprop] or adjoint method [adjoint].

[ode_type]:
This is the type of ODE that we are attempting to learn.
    - [cubic]
        y' = -0.1 * x^3 + 2.0 * y^3
        x' = -2.0 * x^3 + -0.1 * y^3

[neural net type]:
This is the object that the input is passed through in the forward pass
    - [lin]
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(2,2)
        )

    - [nn]
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(2, 50),
            nn.Tanh(),
            nn.Linear(50, 2),
        )

[exponent]:
This is the exponent that the input is raised to element-wise before being passed into the neural network.

[number_of_batches]:
This is the number of batches that are used for training.

[frequency of loss reporting]:
This is the frequency at which the loss is reported. Cryptic nomenclature, I know ;)
